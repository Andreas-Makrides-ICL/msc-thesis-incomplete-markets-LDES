   abstract = {This paper studies the electricity price formation in a competitive market when introducing generation from variable renewable energy technologies with zero marginal cost and electric energy storage systems. A power system is analyzed with a stochastic optimization model combining multi-period optimal power flow with stochastic dynamic programming. The results illustrate how variable renewable energy, in this case solar photo-voltaic generation, displaces some of the expensive thermal generation and reduces the price. Electric energy storage will reduce the price variations caused by the variable renewable generation and demand as the time with price cap and zero price is reduced. In systems with only variable renewable generation and energy storage, the price will be set by the probability of scarcity similar to the price formation in hydro power dominated systems. The price will indicated the future cost of scarcity as a stochastic expectation value. This paper assumes that the demand is inflexible. However, the resulting electricity prices will remunerate provision of flexibility, which in turn will contribute to securing the supply and reducing the price volatility.},

   abstract = {1. For information on battery chemistries and their relative advantages, see Akhil et al. (2013) and Kim et al. (2018). 2. For example, Lew et al. (2013) found that the United States portion of the Western Interconnection could achieve a 33% penetration of wind and solar without additional storage resources. Palchak et al. (2017) found that India could incorporate 160 GW of wind and solar (reaching an annual renewable penetration of 22% of system load) without additional storage resources. What is grid-scale battery storage? Battery storage is a technology that enables power system operators and utilities to store energy for later use. A battery energy storage system (BESS) is an electrochemical device that charges (or collects energy) from the grid or a power plant and then discharges that energy at a later time to provide electricity or other grid services when needed. Several battery chemistries are available or under investigation for grid-scale applications, including lithium-ion, lead-acid, redox flow, and molten salt (including sodium-based chemistries). 1 Battery chemistries differ in key technical characteristics (see What are key characteristics of battery storage systems?), and each battery has unique advantages and disadvantages. The current market for grid-scale battery storage in the United States and globally is dominated by lithium-ion chemistries (Figure 1). Due to technological innovations and improved manufacturing capacity, lithium-ion chemistries have experienced a steep price decline of over 70% from 2010-2016, and prices are projected to decline further (Curry 2017). Increasing needs for system flexibility, combined with rapid decreases in the costs of battery technology, have enabled BESS to play an increasing role in the power system in recent years. As prices for BESS continue to decline and the need for system flexibility increases with wind and solar deployment, more policymakers, regulators, and utilities are seeking to develop policies to jump-start BESS deployment. Is grid-scale battery storage needed for renewable energy integration? Battery storage is one of several technology options that can enhance power system flexibility and enable high levels of renewable energy integration. Studies and real-world experience have demonstrated that interconnected power systems can safely and reliably integrate high levels of renewable energy from variable renewable energy (VRE) sources without new energy storage resources. 2 There is no rule-of-thumb for how much battery storage is needed to integrate high levels of renewable energy. Instead, the appropriate amount of grid-scale battery storage depends on system-specific characteristics, including: • The current and planned mix of generation technologies • Flexibility in existing generation sources • Interconnections with neighboring power systems • The hourly, daily, and seasonal profile of electricity demand, and • The hourly, daily, and seasonal profile of current and planned VRE.},

   abstract = {Studies looking at electricity market designs for very high shares of wind and solar often conclude that the energy-only market will break down. Without fuel costs, it is said that there is nothing to set prices. Symptoms of breakdown include long phases of zero prices, scarcity prices too high to be politically acceptable, prices that collapse under small perturbations of capacities from the long-term equilibrium, cost recovery that is impossible due to low market values, high variability of revenue between different weather years, and difficulty operating long-term storage with limited foresight. We argue that all these problems are an artefact of modelling with perfectly inelastic demand. If short-term elasticity to reflect today's flexible demand (-5%) is implemented, these problems are reduced. The interaction of demand willingness to pay and storage opportunity costs is enough to produce stable pricing. This behavior is illustrated by a model with wind, solar, batteries, and hydrogen-based storage, where the price duration curve is smoothed with a piecewise linear demand curve. This removes high price peaks, reduces the fraction of zero-price hours from 90% to around 30%, and guarantees more price stability for perturbations of capacity and different weather years. Furthermore, we show that with demand elasticity, the long-term optimisation model exactly reproduces the prices of the short-term model with the same capacities. We then use insights from the long-term model to derive simple bidding strategies for storage so that we can also run the short-term model with limited operational foresight. We demonstrate this short-term operation in a model optimised using 35 years of weather data and then tested on another 35 years of unseen data. We conclude that the energy-only market can still play a key role in coordinating dispatch and investment in the future.},

The peaking potential for a given storage duration is the amount of storage that can be added to a power system before that storage can no longer serve the peak net demand period at full rated capacity. We found that for the United States, 168 h of storage would be sufficient to serve about 27 % of peak demand, or about 215 GW in the current system. However, more than one-half of this amount could be served by storage with 12 h or less of capacity. As deployment of wind and solar grows, the peaking potential increases significantly, and under decarbonization scenarios, approximately one-half of the peak demand could be served by storage of up to 168 h; but again, the majority of this storage could be with durations of up to 12 h. The potential is also driven by the mix of wind and solar, and by storage efficiency, with the deployment of solar having the largest impact for both storage peaking potential and the mix of durations.},

The paper first compares the cases of complete and fully incomplete markets (full risk trading and no risk trading). It continues by testing the impact of different risk trading contracts on both welfare and investment. We successively consider Contracts for Difference, Reliability Options with and without physical back up that we add to our Energy Only market model. We test the impact of market liquidity on the results. Finally, we compare these methods to a Forward Capacity Market that we also add to the energy only model.

   abstract = {Electrical energy storage could play an important role in decarbonizing the electricity sector by offering a new, carbon-free source of operational flexibility, improving the utilization of generation assets, and facilitating the integration of variable renewable energy sources. Yet, the future cost of energy storage technologies is uncertain, and the value that they can bring to the system depends on multiple factors. Moreover, the marginal value of storage diminishes as more energy storage capacity is deployed. To explore the potential value of energy storage in deep decarbonization of the electricity sector, we assess the impact of increasing levels of energy storage capacity on both power system operations and investments in generation capacity using a generation capacity expansion model with detailed unit commitment constraints. In a case study of a system with load and renewable resource characteristics from the U.S. state of Texas, we find that energy storage delivers value by increasing the cost-effective penetration of renewable energy, reducing total investments in nuclear power and gas-fired peaking units, and improving the utilization of all installed capacity. However, we find that the value delivered by energy storage with a 2-hour storage capacity only exceeds current technology costs under strict emissions limits, implying that substantial cost reductions in battery storage are needed to justify large-scale deployment. In contrast, storage resources with a 10-hour storage capacity deliver value consistent with the current cost of pumped hydroelectric storage. In general, while energy storage appears essential to enable decarbonization strategies dependent on very high shares of wind and solar energy, storage is not a requisite if a diverse mix of flexible, low-carbon power sources is employed, including flexible nuclear power.},

   abstract = {Liberalized power markets are characterized by a missing market problem: a limited availability of long-term contracts leaves risk-averse investors exposed to uninsured risk. We explore how this problem affects a power system's capacity mix and overall emissions. For this purpose, we develop a new equilibrium generation expansion model that endogenously captures investors’ risk exposure in incomplete markets. Our approach addresses the problem of multiple equilibria and, partly, the computational burden inherent to such models. We solve our model for an abstract system with gas, wind, solar, and battery storage under demand and gas price uncertainty. The results first show that, when risk markets are missing, investment risk can cause higher emissions and less clean energy investment than what would be implied by a model that omits investment risk. The impact of risk on investment depends only partly on technologies’ capital intensities and largely on how technologies interact at the systems level. We also compare system outcomes with missing long-term markets to the socially optimal case, where risk-averse investors and consumers trade risk via complete long-term markets. In the absence of long-term markets, we observe higher emissions, less investment in renewables and storage, and more investment in gas. These results suggest that long-term market mechanisms for electricity generation and storage may advance climate goals while addressing inefficiencies in current markets.},

   abstract = {Reliable and affordable electricity systems based on variable energy sources, such as wind and solar may depend on the ability to store large quantities of low-cost energy over long timescales. Here, we use 39 years of hourly U.S. weather data, and a macro-scale energy model to evaluate capacities and dispatch in least cost, 100% reliable electricity systems with wind and solar generation supported by long-duration storage (LDS; 10 h or greater) and battery storage. We find that the introduction of LDS lowers total system costs relative to wind-solar-battery systems, and that system costs are twice as sensitive to reductions in LDS costs as to reductions in battery costs. In least-cost systems, batteries are used primarily for intra-day storage and LDS is used primarily for inter-season and multi-year storage. Moreover, dependence on LDS increases when the system is optimized over more years. LDS technologies could improve the affordability of renewable electricity. Laws in several U.S. states now require the adoption of zero-carbon electricity systems based primarily on renewable technologies, such as wind and solar. Long-term, large-capacity energy storage may ease reliability and affordability challenges of systems based on these naturally variable generation resources. Long-duration storage technologies (10 h or greater) have very different cost structures compared with Li-ion battery storage. Using a multi-decadal weather dataset, our results reveal that long-duration storage can fill unique roles, like seasonal and even multi-year storage, making it valuable to least-cost electricity systems. Indeed, we find that variable renewable power systems are much more sensitive to reductions in long-duration storage costs than to equal reductions in battery costs. Long-term modeling horizons, typically not used by utilities and regulators, are necessary to capture the role and value of long-term storage, informing technology investments and policy. Laws in several U.S. states mandate zero-carbon electricity systems based primarily on renewable technologies, such as wind and solar. Long-term, large-capacity energy storage, such as those that might be provided by power-to-gas-to-power systems, may improve reliability and affordability of systems based on variable non-dispatchable generation. Long-term storage can reduce costs of wind-solar-battery electricity systems at current technology costs by filling seasonal and multi-year storage functional roles. Innovation in long-term storage technology could further improve the affordability of reliable renewable electricity.},

It argues that additional incentives may need to be put into place in order to render storage over relatively longer periods more attractive and to deliver broader social benefits which are unlikely to be generated and captured as a result of purely commercial considerations.},

   abstract = {A new approach is required to determine a technology's value to the power systems of the 21st century. Conventional cost-based metrics are incapable of accounting for the indirect system costs associated with intermittent electricity generation, in addition to environmental and security constraints. In this work, we formalise a new concept for power generation and storage technology valuation which explicitly accounts for system conditions, integration challenges, and the level of technology penetration. The centrepiece of the system value (SV) concept is a whole electricity systems model on a national scale, which simultaneously determines the ideal power system design and unit-wise operational strategy. It brings typical Process Systems Engineering thinking into the analysis of power systems. The model formulation is a mixed-integer linear optimisation and can be understood as hybrid between a generation expansion and a unit commitment model. We present an analysis of the future UK electricity system and investigate the SV of carbon capture and storage equipped power plants (CCS), onshore wind power plants, and grid-level energy storage capacity. We show how the availability of different low-carbon technologies impact the optimal capacity mix and generation patterns. We find that the SV in the year 2035 of grid-level energy storage is an order of magnitude greater than that of CCS and wind power plants. However, CCS and wind capacity provide a more consistent value to the system as their level of deployment increases. Ultimately, the incremental system value of a power technology is a function of the prevalent system design and constraints.},

The chapter presents a systematic analysis of the concepts and mathematical techniques needed for a proper understanding of the behavior of GEI equilibria. While real assets are inflation proof, nominal assets are not. The economic consequence is the striking property exhibited by the GEI model with nominal assets: indeterminacy if the model is left unchanged and nonneutrality of money if a role is introduced for money as a medium of exchange. The chapter presents an analysis of the GEI model of a production economy: it is the theory that encounters great difficulties. When markets are incomplete each firm faces a public goods problem with respect to its constituency of shareholders (and employees) for which there is no evident solution. The chapter also presents a reasonably coherent view of the current status of the theory of incomplete markets. © 1991, Elsevier Science Publishers B.V. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Energy-only electricity markets, such as the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), rely on the decentralized investment decisions of market participants to lead to a resource mix providing an efficient level of reliability. During an exceptionally cold winter storm in February 2021, ERCOT experienced shortfalls on an unprecedented scale, with nearly half of the generation fleet experiencing outages at the peak. The depth of the resulting blackouts invites questions regarding the ability of systems relying on decentralized planning to appropriately prepare for and withstand rare events. Based on two mild assumptions, risk aversion among investors and incomplete risk trading, this paper provides an explanation for why decentralized markets are prone to underinvestment in resilience. We describe the nature of the incomplete risk trading that arises in the context of electricity markets and discuss potential remedies, including mandatory contracting obligations for retailers and compensation to end users for unserved energy.},

These payments help stabilize generator revenues, making investment in capacity more attractive for risk-averse investors when other outlets for risk trading are limited. Here we develop a heuristic algorithm to solve large-scale stochastic equilibrium models describing a competitive market with incomplete risk trading. Introduction of a capacity mechanism has an asymmetric effect on the risk profile of different generation technologies, tilting the resource mix towards those with lower fixed costs and higher operating costs. One implication of this result is that current market structures may be ill-suited to financing low-carbon resources, the most scalable of which have high fixed costs and near-zero operating costs. Development of new risk trading mechanisms to replace or complement current capacity obligations could lead to more efficient outcomes.},

   abstract = {Abstract: The future U.S. electric grid is being transformed with deep decarbonization of generation (i.e., removing or reducing reliance on fossil fuels and replacing them with renewable and clean energy resources), which in practice is not achievable without a dramatic increase in the reliance on long-duration energy storage (LDES) technologies. Regulators at both the state and federal level are well advised to take steps to address current policy gaps, build frameworks that will enable a greater role for LDES to contribute to grid reliability and be fairly compensated for its grid services. Decarbonization by definition is dependent on an increasing reliance on variable renewable energy, primarily wind and solar resources, that needs to be stored for longer durations to maintain electric grid reliability and provide operational flexibility to grid operators. However, despite the growing realization of the need for long-duration energy storage (LDES) technologies, a persistent gap of policy levers at the federal and state level creates a vacuum in terms of defining how and where LDES technologies can be utilized to support the electric grid, along with an inadequate regulatory framework wherein these resources will need to be valued and compensated for the services they can provide. This paper—which is primarily intended for US decision makers, but should be of value for all energy professionals and the general public—addresses policy gaps, needs, and opportunities for LDES that require urgent attention from US-based policymakers at the federal and state level. This paper also provides background information on how the US E&U industry is structured and regulated, along with perspectives on LDES technologies and applications, all of which have direct relevance to the paper’s primary focus on the need for LDES policymaking. Discussion: Despite a generally accepted future need for long-duration energy storage (LDES) technologies that is directly tied to the rapid of renewable resources on the U.S. electric grid, there is a lack of policymaking, market designs, and compensation mechanisms for LDES technologies. Decarbonization (i.e., the goal of removing or reducing reliance on fossil fuels) cannot be achieved at the aggressive levels envisioned without utilizing LDES. Policymakers must take steps now to build frameworks that recognize the unique ways in which LDES will increasingly contribute to grid reliability and resilience, and receive appropriate compensation for the services it provides.

A hydrogen network reusing the existing gas network could not only help to supply the demand for low-emission fuels but could also balance variations in wind and solar energies across the continent and thus avoid power grid expansion. Our investigation varies the allowed expansion of electricity and hydrogen grids in net-zero CO2 scenarios for a sector-coupled European energy system, capturing transmission bottlenecks, renewable supply and demand variability, and pipeline retrofitting and geological storage potentials. We find that a hydrogen network connecting regions with low-cost and abundant renewable potentials to demand centers, electrofuel production, and cavern storage sites reduces system costs by up to 26 bn€/a (3.4%). Although expanding both networks together can achieve the largest cost reductions, by 9.9%, the expansion of neither is essential for a net-zero system as long as higher costs can be accepted and flexibility options allow managing transmission bottlenecks.},

   abstract = {Mitigating climate change is driving the need to decarbonize the electricity sector, for which various possible technological options exist, alongside uncertainty over which options are preferable in terms of cost, emissions reductions, and energy security. To reduce this uncertainty, we here quantify two questions for the power system of Great Britain (England, Wales and Scotland): First, when compared within the same high-resolution modeling framework, how much do different combinations of technologies differ in these three respects? Second, how strongly does the cost and availability of grid-scale storage affect overall system cost, and would it favor some technology combinations above others? We compare three main possible generation technologies: (1) renewables, (2) nuclear, and (3) fossil fuels (with/without carbon capture and storage). Our results show that across a wide range of these combinations, the overall costs remain similar, implying that different configurations are equally feasible both technically and economically. However, the most economically favorable scenarios are not necessarily favorable in terms of emissions or energy security. The availability of grid-scale storage in scenarios with little dispatchable generation can reduce overall levelized electricity cost by up to 50%, depending on storage capacity costs. The UK can rely on its domestic wind and solar PV generation at lower renewable shares, with levelized costs only rising more than 10% above the mean of 0.084 GBP/kWh for shares of 50% and below at a 70% share, which is 35% higher. However, for more than an 80% renewable generation share to be economically feasible, large-scale storage, significantly more power imports, or domestic dispatchable renewables like tidal range must be available.},

   abstract = {Long-duration energy storage (LDES) is a potential solution to intermittency in renewable energy generation. In this study we have evaluated the role of LDES in decarbonized electricity systems and identified the cost and efficiency performance necessary for LDES to substantially reduce electricity costs and displace firm low-carbon generation. Our findings show that energy storage capacity cost and discharge efficiency are the most important performance parameters. Charge/discharge capacity cost and charge efficiency play secondary roles. Energy capacity costs must be ≤US$20 kWh–1 to reduce electricity costs by ≥10%. With current electricity demand profiles, energy capacity costs must be ≤US$1 kWh–1 to fully displace all modelled firm low-carbon generation technologies. Electrification of end uses in a northern latitude context makes full displacement of firm generation more challenging and requires performance combinations unlikely to be feasible with known LDES technologies. Finally, LDES systems with the greatest impact on electricity cost and firm generation have storage durations exceeding 100 h.},

   abstract = {A new approach to optimizing or hedging a portfolio of ®nancial instruments to reduce risk is presented and tested on applications. It focuses on minimizing conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) rather than minimizing value-at-risk (VaR), but portfolios with low CVaR necessarily have low VaR as well. CVaR, also called mean excess loss, mean shortfall, or tail VaR, is in any case considered to be a more consistent measure of risk than VaR. Central to the new approach is a technique for portfolio optimization which calculates VaR and optimizes CVaR simultaneously. This technique is suitable for use by investment companies, brokerage ®rms, mutual funds, and any business that evaluates risk. It can be combined with analytical or scenario-based methods to optimize portfolios with large numbers of instruments, in which case the calculations often come down to linear programming or nonsmooth programming. The methodology can also be applied to the optimization of percentiles in contexts outside of ®nance.},

@article{Williams2022,
   abstract = {Electricity storage is likely to be an important factor in balancing fluctuations in renewable generators' output, but concentrated ownership could lead to market power. We model this for short-term (daily) storage in the British electricity wholesale market, with generating companies acting as either price-takers or Cournot competitors. We discuss how competitive storage charging and discharging behaviour depends on the balance between the market price and shadow price of stored electricity. Electricity storage raises welfare, consumer surplus and renewable generators’ revenues, while reducing revenues for conventional generators. Market power in storage slightly reduces the welfare gains; Cournot behaviour by generators reduces welfare but has relatively little impact on the incremental effect of storage. Market power in electricity storage is undesirable, but market power in generation is much worse. The interactions between market power in generation and in storage are complex, suggesting that predictions from one market may not apply elsewhere and context-specific modelling will be valuable.},

   abstract = {In electricity price forecast, deep networks have shown promising due to their strong nonlinear modeling capability but corresponding design tricks are not convincible, reflecting the situation that biologically-inspired networks in time-series analysis are still not enough explored. To this end, this paper proposes a multi-scale visual-inspired network with three explored modules, namely MSV-Net, for electricity price forecasting. In particular, through simulating both the ocular globe and neurons in signal conversion and further enhancement, the multi-scale feature extraction module captures the overall and specific time-scale features via multiple convolutional kernels and especially highlights the core features via self-attention mechanisms. Through imitating the left and right hemispheres in analyzing and producing complementary visual information, the dual-stream collaboration module adopts the convolutional layer and gated recurrent unit to extract and integrate time-dependent relationships in parallel, thus improving the model stability. Through simulating the higher visual region in understanding complex environments, the forecasting module is introduced to forecast the electricity price. The layer-by-layer collaboration of the above three modules guarantees the effectiveness of the MSV-Net. Moreover, four comprehensive evaluation metrics are explored to assess the forecasting performance in peak, low, and normal samples. Experiments and discussions under two electricity price datasets show that the MSV-Net has satisfactory forecasting accuracy and stability, in improving average mean absolute percent error of 31.59 % and 25.15 % for two datasets compared with 12 baselines, and shows extensible in other energy forecasting fields.},

The paper particularly examines five crucial environmental aspects and associated causal factors. The five domains include human resettlement and the carrying capacity of local environments (especially land), water quality, reservoir sedimentation and downstream riverbed erosion, soil erosion, and seismic activity and geological hazards. Lessons from the environmental impact assessments of the TGP are: (1) hydro project planning needs to take place at a broader scale, and a strategic environmental assessment at a broader scale is necessary in advance of individual environmental impact assessments; (2) national policy and planning adjustments need to react quickly to the impact changes of large projects; (3) long-term environmental monitoring systems and joint operations with other large projects in the upstream areas of a river basin should be established, and the cross-impacts of climate change on projects and possible impacts of projects on regional or local climate considered. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},
