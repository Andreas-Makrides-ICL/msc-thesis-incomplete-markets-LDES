# MSc Thesis: Incomplete Markets in Risk and Storage Duration in Future Markets

This repository contains code, data, and documents for my MSc thesis at Imperial College London.

## 📘 Summary

The project investigates how incomplete markets and risk aversion impact investment in long-duration energy storage (LDES), inspired by recent work on resilience and decentralized markets. Optimization models in Julia will simulate scenarios under both complete and incomplete markets.

## 🛠 Tools Used

- **Julia** – for capacity expansion modeling (central planner & ADMM)
- **Python** – for data cleaning and representative year selection
