# MSc Thesis: Incomplete Markets in Risk and Storage Duration in Future Markets

This repository contains the work for my MSc thesis at Imperial College London. 

## 📘 Summary

The project investigates how incomplete markets and risk aversion impact investment in long-duration energy storage (LDES).

## 🔍 Project Overview

Inspired by prior research on underinvestment in resilience, this work investigates inefficiencies caused by incomplete risk trading. Models simulate both fully complete and fully incomplete market scenarios using the GB greenfield test system.
